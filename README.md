README - Aarhus Houses
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Motivation for the project:

I wanted to challenge myself while learning about new libraries. This ended up being web-
scraping so, i could gather my own data. Clean the data with Pandas and 'analyze' it with
the Matplotlib. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
What is it?(Usage):

The scraper will collect housing data from the specified website and save it to a CSV file.
Afterwards the data_analysis.py will clean the CSV, so it is ready for analysis. 
In this case it is a simple scatterplot, between th house price and the m^2 of the house.
